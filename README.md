# YouTube-Music-Volume-Fixer

A firefox plugin to fix the maximum value on the volume slider.

After installation, click on the extension icon and select a value to override the maximum value of the volume slider on the YouTube Music player.

I created this browser extension because I noticed that I was only using the first 10% of YouTube Music's volume slider. To fix this, I figured I could make a script that allows me to customize the maximum value of the slider to my personal preference. Since audio is crucial to a music-focused website, I decided to turn this script into a plugin that others with my similar issue can use. I figured it was also a neat project to do on the side, not having made any browser extensions or this type of usage of JavaScript previously.

Hope you enjoy it. :)
